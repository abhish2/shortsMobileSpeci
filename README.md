# shortsMobileSpeci

I developed an automatic youtube video uploading script. it's able to scrap web content and make it a youtube short video and upload it on youtube automatically.

Used technologies
* python (developing language)
* beautifulsoup (scraping website content)
* firebase (store website URLs and other metadata)
* pillow (editing images)
* moviepy (convert images into a video and add music)
* google developer app (get access to youtube video upload)
* flask (convert the script as web application)
* Heroku (upload script for hosting in server, help to upload video from anywhere)
* cronjob site ( scheduling script calling)
